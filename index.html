            <p style="text-align:justify;">Hello there! My name is Tanima Sultana Nitu, and I am from the beautiful town of Panchagarh Sadar in Rangpur, Bangladesh. I come from a big family, and I believe that family is everything. It is where we belong, and it is what defines us.<br><br>

            Growing up, my family has always been my strength. We have not moved to an urban area, so we still live together as a wider circle with our extended family. My father is a shopkeeper, and my mother is a housewife. I have one sister who is a trainer for the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, and I am the second daughter in my nuclear family.<br><br>

            I am proud to say that I have two aunts and four uncles, and my cousins are nineteen in number. Most of them are currently in school, except for the youngest ones. Having such a big family has taught me the value of teamwork and the importance of moral values.<br><br>

            I believe that my family has played a significant role in shaping who I am today. They have always been there to support me through the good times and the bad times, and I am grateful for their unwavering love and support.<br><br>

            In conclusion, I am just a simple girl from Panchagarh Sadar who believes in the power of family. I am proud of where I come from, and I will always cherish the memories and values that my family has instilled in me.
